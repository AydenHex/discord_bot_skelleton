Welcome to the deposit of my bot discord skeleton

**Necessary for the bot:**

 - Node.JS
 - npm

**Tutorial**

First you need to create your bot on : https://github.com/AydenHex/discord_bot_skelleton and click on "New App".

Then complete what you want before clicking on "Create App".

After that, click all the way down on "Create a bot user" then reveal the token before copying it.

Save it in "logs.json".

Finally, recover your Discord ID by activating the developer mode (on discord: Parameter -> Developer mode) and copy it to "logs.json"

You just have to download the dependencies with npm ("npm install") and launch the bot "nodemon index.js"


**Dependencies** :

 - discord.js
 - discord.js-commando
 - nodemon (for dev only)
